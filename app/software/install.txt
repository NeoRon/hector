Install OSSEC

The OSSEC installer is located in the /app/software directory.  The version of
OSSEC is 2.3, which is slightly older than the version available at the time of
this writing, however the 2.6 version currenlty available doesn't have any 
compelling features or bug fixes that would mandate it's use so we're using an
older but stable, proven, version.

To begin installation 

Install Kojoney

Kojoney is an open source SSH honeypot.  It has been customized to allow for 
some additional functionality beyond what is offered from the official software
repository (http://kojoney.sourceforge.net).  The Kojoney installer can be found
in the /app/software directory as well.  

Before installing Kojoney you'll want to move any SSH service currently listen-
ing on port 22 to an alternate port.  You'll also want to ensure that your fire-
wall allows connections to TCP port 22.

Next, make sure you have the requisite software packages.  On a RHEL (or CentOS)
machine you'll need the following, which can be installed via yum:

gcc make python-twisted python-twisted-conch mysql mysql-client mysql-devel
python-zope-interface MySQL-python python-devel perl-ExUtils-MakeMaker

To install Kojoney first unpack the software using:

$ tar xvzf kojoney_with_changes.tgz

Next you'll need to read the 'install' file for additional details.  The main 
step is to alter create_tables.sql to use the 'hector' database instead of the 
default 'kojoney' database.  You'll also need to alter the coret_config.py file
to point to the HECTOR database with appropriate credentials.  

Next, create the necessary MySQL support you'll need to run the 
create_tables.sql file as follows:

$ mysql -u hector_user -p hector < create_tables.sql

In order to use the default credentials run the following MySQL command as root:

mysql> GRANT INSERT PRIVILEGES ON hector.login_attempts
mysql> to 'kojoney_user'@localhost identified by 'kojoney_pass';
mysql> GRANT INSERT PRIVILEGES ON hector.executed_commands
mysql> to 'kojoney_user'@localhost identified by 'kojoney_pass';

Lastly install Kojoney using:

$ sudo ./install.bash
