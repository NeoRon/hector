There are two directories for the application: app and html.  The app directory
is designed to be placed outside of your web server's web root (so that it 
isn't exposed via the web service).  The html directory is supposed to be 
placed in the web root.  Once you have placed both these files update the 
conf/config.ini file in the app directory to reflect your environment.

First create a database and user from MySQL:
mysql> create database hector;
mysql> grant all privileges on hector.* to 'hector_user'@localhost 
  identified by 'hector_pass';

Next populate the database using the installation script:
$ mysql -u root -p < sql/db.sql
 
OSSEC should be installed in server mode on the same host, or should at least
make logs accessible to the host.  There is a Perl script, designed to be run
daily, that scans the OSSEC logs and imports them into HECTOR's database.  This
script is located at scripts/ossec_logreader.pl.  This script should be
scheduled (via cron) to be run nightly.

To run scheduled scans you must also create a scheduled (cron) job for the 
script at scripts/scan_cron.php.  This script is designed to be run using the 
PHP command line interface (CLI) and can be set with something like:

01 0 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/app/scripts/scan_cron.php

The script examines database settings and hands off to the various other PHP 
scripts that actually run scans.  Be aware that the nmap_scan.php script writes
an XML file of output, so be wary of what user account runs this script so 
that the scan result XML file is protected.

You can log into the web interface through your web browser, for instance at:
http://192.168.0.1/html/

The installation script creates an 'administrator' account with the password 
'password'.  Note that you can create other accounts by following the template
in sql/db.sql.  HECTOR is configured to utilize CoSign authentication if avail-
able, so all you need to do is create accounts, and fill in bogus passwords,
for CoSign authenticated accounts.
